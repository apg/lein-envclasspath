# lein-envclasspath

This shouldn't be needed as :extra-classpath-libs should be able to handle it, however, it doesn't work for me so this was my solution until I figure that out.

## Usage

Add :dev-dependencies [[lein-envclasspath "0.1.2"]] though, this isn't on clojars or anything (TODO: fix that)

Add :hooks [leiningen.hooks.envclasspath]

Set your CLASSPATH somehow
